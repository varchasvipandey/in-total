## About 

<br/>

While diving deeper and deeper into React, I read something about a 3kb variant of React named Preact! My eagerness made me open the the link and create a template application using the CLI commands. A few days of exploration and understanding made me realize that this micro version of React can actually do some really cool stuff, or I should say, everything that React can do. Plus, it comes with router built right into it! 

I then decide to make a very basic application to understand a few aspects of this library like, how its router works, how to manage pages and how to work with states and other hooks. So, I made this very basic calculator application. Yes, it is super basic application, I mean, what else can you think when you are presented with a "calculator". But, I was quite excited to build this as I wanted to trace a really cool UI design made by [Ana Clara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anacriando/). I then made a few changes to the [origin design](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6806575424374665216/) according to the features and came up with this application!

It took me around 5 hours to complete this application (20-30 mins a day for 10 days ðŸ˜‰)
